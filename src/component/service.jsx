            2.  Medication Prescriptions
          </h1>
          <p>Thanks to the new Bill 31, pharmacists can do even more to help you deal with your health issues. Thanks to your pharmacist, access to healthcare is now quick and easy. In cases where a diagnosis is not required or for certain minor conditions, for which a treatment was already prescribed during the past 2 to 5 years, your pharmacist may now prescribe medication. They may even alter your treatment – if you experience adverse side effects, for example. Should this happen and as necessary, your doctor would be advised of changes.

Each time a prescription refill is prepared, a member of the pharmacy team will contact you to let you know that your medication is ready. You then can come and pick it up when it is convenient for you, or even have it delivered to your home. What’s more, your pharmacist will always be available to monitor your treatment. Why not use this service that is meant to make your life easier?
